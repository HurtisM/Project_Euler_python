# Problem 51
# By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values:
# 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.
# By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example
# having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773,
# and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.
#
# Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit,
# is part of an eight prime value family.
